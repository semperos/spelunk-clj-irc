## Statistics for Clojure's IRC Logs

This README acts as a todo list of stats to pull from the Clojure logs. Nothing here is a promise.

* Total unique visitors
* Total messages
* Total mentions of particular languages (Java, Ruby, Lisp)
* Total mentions/uses of state (atoms, refs, vars)
* Clojurebot vs Sexpbot use
* For a user, total messages
* For a user, total days "online" (at least one message)
* For a user, total messages with Java interop forms
* Top users
* Top days (number of messages)
* Top Clojure fn's mentioned/used

And then over time:

* Unique visitors per day/week/month over a period
* Messages per day/week/month over a period
* etc. of the above, per a unit of measure over a period of time
