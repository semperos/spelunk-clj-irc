## Statistics for Clojure's IRC Logs

This README acts as a todo list of stats to pull from the Clojure logs. Nothing here is a promise.

* [DONE] Total unique visitors
* [DONE] Total messages
* [DONE] Total times single Clojure fn is used in the channel
* [DONE] Total mentions of particular languages (Java, Ruby, Lisp)
* Total mentions/uses of state (atoms, refs, vars)
* Clojurebot vs Sexpbot use
* [DONE] For a user, total messages
* [DONE] For a user, total days "online" (at least one message)
* For a user, total messages with Java interop forms
* Top users (by number of messages, by top days online)
* Top days (number of messages)
* Top Clojure fn's mentioned/used

And then over time:

* Unique visitors per day/week/month over a period
* Messages per day/week/month over a period
* etc. of the above, per a unit of measure over a period of time

Others:

* Sites linked to (consume the RSS from clojurebot's delicious account?)
